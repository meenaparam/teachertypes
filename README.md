# teachertypes
This project uses data from the LKMco/Pearson "Why Teach" dataset to analyse responses to teacher motivation and preference questions. It aims to identify types of teachers, using latent class analysis, and then to classify teachers into classes. There's no data here, but contact me if you'd like to see the data.
